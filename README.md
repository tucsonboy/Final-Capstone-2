# Final-Capstone-2
Airlines are constantly trying to improve on-time performance. I have created a model to help schedule flights into Miami International Airport that predicts weather delays during the summer travel months.  
  
In data wrangling [airline.ipynb](https://github.com/tucsonboy/Final-Capstone-2/blob/1ee79c118fbd5049dd4a03b4123bc90812b36849/data%20wrangling%20airline.ipynb), I concated all the seperate csv files and deleted flights that were either diverted or cancelled as well as dealt with null values in the data.  
  
In [Airline 11.5 Capstone EDA_solved.](https://github.com/tucsonboy/Final-Capstone-2/blob/1ee79c118fbd5049dd4a03b4123bc90812b36849/Airline%2011.5%20Capstone%20EDA_solved.ipynb), preliminary data analysis is done looking at basic statistics and trends of the data.
  
In [16.3_Capstone_two.ipynb](https://github.com/tucsonboy/Final-Capstone-2/blob/1ee79c118fbd5049dd4a03b4123bc90812b36849/16.3_Capstone_two.ipynb), the data is prepared for modeling.
  
[18.3_capstone_no0.ipynb](https://github.com/tucsonboy/Final-Capstone-2/blob/1ee79c118fbd5049dd4a03b4123bc90812b36849/18.3_capstone_no0.ipynb), training and test data is created, models are run and compared and findings are interpreted.  
  
A model with a 68% certainty was created to help schedule flights into the MIA during the peak summer travel months that also coincide with peak weather months of Miami.
